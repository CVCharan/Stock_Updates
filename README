This is an application to monitor stock updates.
In this application, we are monitoring NSE-India, FTSE and stock prices of few Indian IT companies.
However, the same concept can be applied to monitor stocks of other enlisted companies  and stock markets as well.

To develop this application, we have used:
1.WebWorkers
2.HighCharts.js
3.Yahoo Query Language(YQL)

Challenges faced:
1) Finding a credible data source on any website/server/api.
(We have solved this problem using YQL.)
2) Designing the web workers functioning.
